                    <p class="words line2">I am writing this to express the things I admire about you. Yknow, at first sight, those smiles you possess made time stands still. Words couldn't describe, but there was a heart that you fill. Your style & beaut shines out from the other. It drew me in like a hidden tether, and I know in that moment I wanted to know you deeper. The moment we started to talk, it was a delight. As each word shared, I felt that we are very much alike. And the time we hangout and play, your adorable vibe and energy, creates memories that forever stay.</p>
